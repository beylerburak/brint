You are working on a TypeScript monorepo with apps/api and apps/web.

Always follow these rules:

1. Before changing or generating any code, ALWAYS read:
   - docs/dev-workflow.md
   - docs/tiny-steps.md
   - docs/backend-architecture.md (for backend work)
   - docs/frontend-architecture.md (for frontend work)
   - docs/auth-claims-i18n.md (for auth/claims/i18n work)

2. We use Tiny Steps (TS-XX). When the user refers to a TS:
   - Only work on that specific TS.
   - Do not start another TS unless explicitly asked.
   - At the end, explain how the TS test criteria are satisfied.
   - A TS is NOT complete until all test criteria are met.

3. Do NOT introduce new patterns or architectures.
   - Follow the existing folder structure and naming conventions.
   - No hard-coded config; always use env → config → code flow.
   - Magic strings and direct env access are forbidden; use config files (src/config/*.ts).

4. If something is unclear:
   - Propose a safe default and clearly explain it in the summary.
